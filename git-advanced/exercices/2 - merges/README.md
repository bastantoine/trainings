# Merges

Using https://learngitbranching.js.org/?locale=fr_FR&NODEMO=, http://git-school.github.io/visualizing-git/#free, or in a local repo, try to manipulate some branches, and merge them against the others to see what happens.

Try the different merge methods:
- fast-forward
- true merge
- squash
- octopus

What is the default behavior? In which case does which merge method applies?
